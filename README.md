# The-Office-Name-Generator
A program that randomly merges the first and last name of characters from the office. 

This program  takes two seperate lists (tuples) of first and last names, selects one from each at random, and combines the two together. 
Once combined, the randomly generated name will print to the console.
User may choose to keep the program running after each new name is displayed, or user can choose to exit the program.
